# germbox

In addition to washing things with soap & water, applying peroxide vapor, and plain old sunlight, Germbox can help sterilize masks and other PPE using UVC light.  Please consult a professional, kids!

# Assembly Instructions

1. UVC lamp
- Discard the pump assembly.
- There are four interior metal screws holding the two halves of the plastic housing together.  To avoid damaging the expensive lamp bulbs, carefully saw through these screws with the Dremel, cutting along the seams running down the sides of the housing.  I first made a small cut lengthwise on the broad flat side of the housing, and backstopped the screws with a flathead screwdriver.  Be careful not to damage the lamps!

- Once the four interior screws are cut, the plastic housing easily pops apart.
2. Igloo Cooler
- Line the cooler with the shiny reflective side of the aluminum foil.
- Using the spade bit, drill an opening for the UVC lamp about 2" above the bottom of the cooler (where the casing dimples in).  Expand this hole to size using the jab saw, if necessary.  Warning - the cooler shell and interior foam will scatter everywhere!
3. Drill the 4 two-inch screws into the cooler's sides (see diagram).  These will hold up the wire rack inside the cooler.  The wire rack will hold the objects you want sterilized safely above the lamps.
4. Cut the wire rack to size (16" is the correct length, but it is slight too wide for the cooler).
5. Hook up the countdown timer to your lamp's power supply.
6. Close the cooler lid, plug it in, set the timer to 30 minutes (est.), and let it zap away.
